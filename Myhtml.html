            Perfected Ultra Instinct (Migatte no Goku'i no Kansei, "Ultra
            Instinct Perfected"), often simply referred to as Ultra Instinct (‚Äù
            Migatte no Goku'i "Kyoku"),is an extremely powerful transformation
            that is obtained through the completion of Autonomous Ultra
            Instinct, far surpassing the Ultra Instinct Sign form. Angels are
            always in this state, though they can turn the ability on or off if
            they so choose.

        <p class="txt1">
          This form is essentially identical to the initial state of
          <em>Ultra Instinct</em> Sign, albeit with the user's hair becoming
          silver in color. The hairstyle is slightly wilder and more solid than
          normal, having no loose strands. The eyes take on a more stern,
          defined shape, sporting silver-colored irises, and visible pupils.
          Also, in the manga, the user generally has a focused but calm
          expression. In the anime, the user gains a complex silver and blue
          aura consisting of rippling, fire-like energy, complete with sparkling
          particles of a magenta color.<br /><br />
          In the manga, the user initially gains the complex silver and blue
          aura consisting of rippling, fire-like energy without the sparking
          particles of the magenta color. After the user achieves a more
          sharpened control over the state, the aura becomes non-present. Also,
          in the anime, the user's muscles remain virtually the same mass and
          definition. while initially in the manga, the user's musculature
          becomes slimmed down like Super Saiyan God. By the time Goku activates
          a more sharpened state during the Galactic Patrol Prisoner Saga in the
          manga, the user's musculature is similar to that in the anime.<br /><br />

          Upon the user's first successful transformation into Autonomous Ultra
          Instinct, a "shell" of black and bright white covers the body before
          crumbling away as the hair fades from glowing white to gray. A similar
          effect has been seen in Super Saiyan Blue. In the anime, the
          transformation's extreme energy rips away the user's clothing on their
          torso while in the manga, their clothing remains unaffected. In
          Toriyama's artwork and Super Dragon Ball Heroes (both the game and
          manga), the form possesses Goku's Super Saiyan God hair and eyes
          albeit silver. In the anime, while dodging or evading, Goku's
          movements in this form leave afterimages. His voice also remains
          deeper and rougher like the previous state, though he still speaks his
          own tongue.
